# Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments

## Definitions
**Syntax Parser**\
A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid

**Lexical Environment**\
Where something sits physically in the code you write

**Execution Context**\
A wrapper to help manage the code that is running

## Execution Context
**Global**\
Not inside a function (window object in browser)

**this**\
Special variable inside function - base level of scope

**Outer Environment**\
Everything outside of current scope (is nothing at global level)

## Hoisting
The JavaScript engine sets up memory space for variables and functions upon execution context creation. The code is not actually moved to the top of the file.

‚ùó ES6 'let' and 'const' are not hoisted in the same way as 'var' and must be declared before calling; otherwise, you get a ReferenceError.
